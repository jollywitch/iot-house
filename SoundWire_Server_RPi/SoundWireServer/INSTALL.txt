SoundWire Server Install Instructions for Raspberry Pi / Raspbian
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Note: This version of SoundWire Server for Raspberry Pi is command line only, 
no GUI. It is suitable for minimal systems with no desktop manager or older
Raspberry Pi models (e.g. 1 & 2). For RPi systems running Raspbian Stretch or
later another option is SoundWire Server for RPi, GUI version. 

System Setup:

- Your Raspberry Pi should be running the Raspbian hard-float OS, not the
  soft-float build. Hard-float is the normal default.

- If you're running a firewall, open firewall ports 59010 & 59011 UDP. You may 
  do this from the GUI using firewall-config or a similar utility. 

- Update your package lists to prevent problems below
     sudo apt-get update

- Install audio-related packages needed by SoundWire (Pulse Audio, Pulse Audio
  Volume Control, PortAudio)
     sudo apt-get install pulseaudio
     sudo apt-get install pavucontrol
     sudo apt-get install libportaudio2

- Install any other packages needed to satisfy shared library dependencies if 
  SoundWireServer fails to start. You should run it from the command line to
  see any error messages. Note that PortAudio usually displays a large number 
  of errors, so these are suppressed unless you specify the -verbose option when
  running SoundWireServer.

SoundWire Server Program Installation:

1. Add the directory containing these files to your search path. (You can skip
   this step if you run SoundWireServer from the command line using the full
   path.)

2. At this point you can start SoundWire Server from the command line by typing
   SoundWireServer.
